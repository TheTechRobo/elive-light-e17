# elive-light-e17
This is a very slight modification of the Elive Light theme in the Stable version; its only change is changing the start button icon to an Elive logo created by triantares.

I don't think the source code works; you'd need to modify the start thingy manually (it's in the `modules/start` image). You can find the image [here](https://forum.elivelinux.org/t/assets-for-the-site-design/7/2?u=thetechrobo). Maybe someone can provide a PR that fixes this; maybe I'll fix it myself - I don't know.
